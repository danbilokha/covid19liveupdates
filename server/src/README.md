## Localization
If you kindly want to translate the bot on your local language (or any you desire, actually) you can 
make so by translating all keys in the `base.locale.json`. Just add values to those keys, which will 
be your translation. Then create PR and get it merged :) 

You can take a look English (default) in `locales/en.json` and its translation
in Ukrainian `locales/ua.json`
